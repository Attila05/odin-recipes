    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
    This is a vegetarian version of a classic Hungarian soup.
    For a vegan version, substitute vegan pasta for the noodles.
    You can choose sweet or hot Hungarian pepper, but we like it hot! 
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil </li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Hungarian sweet paprika </li>
        <li>8 ounces textured vegetable protein </li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped </li>
        <li>5 cups vegetable broth </li>
        <li>4 large potatoes, diced </li>
        <li>2 large carrots, diced </li>
        <li>1 tomato, chopped </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley </li>
        <li>1 egg </li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water as needed </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a heavy pot, heat oil over medium heat. Saute onions in oil until tender.</li>
        <li>Add paprika, textured vegetable protein, and green pepper; cook and stir mixture until vegetables are coated with paprika.
            Stir in broth or water, potatoes, carrots, tomato, 1/2 teaspoon salt, black pepper, and parsley. Bring to a boil.
            Cover, reduce heat, and simmer until carrots and potatoes are almost tender. Add more water if needed.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix together, egg, flour, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
            Mix in enough water to have a smooth consistency; dough should be stiff and sticky.
            Spoon onto a flat plate, and slice off small amounts into soup while it is simmering. Add to soup in such a way that noodles do not land in the same spot every time.
            Continue until all mixture has been added to pot. Simmer until done.</li>    
    </ol>
